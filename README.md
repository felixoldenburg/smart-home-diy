# Smart Home DIY

Tracking the journey of creating custom build, µController based Smart Home components.
Wiring them up to automatise repetitive scenarios for light and temperature.

## Motivation
Just picking up an old box with electronic components got me started refreshing knowledge about transistors, µControllers, etc.

As many others I like to learn on the fly while working towards something new to learn or build. Instead of only digging into books and articles without the practical part.

It all started with ...
"Hey, I got this cheap set of simple, but digital heater thermostats. I wonder if these could be modded to be controlled remotely."

## Concept
* Controlling lights and temperature in flat
* Track and optimise heating to save money
* Scenario - A Scenario defines a predefined set of actions or light setup

## Characteristics
- Don't talk to the internet! Specifically to any cloud provider or company
- Aiming for simplicity

## Misc & Considerations
- Leverage iOS Homekit as UI
